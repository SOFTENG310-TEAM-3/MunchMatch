# MunchMatch
MutchMatch is a web application that is designed to recommend users on restaurants that they want to eat by enhancing the search process to be in a more efficient and stylish manner. This project is associated with the University of Auckland course SOFTENG310 and was created by KTTJXM (Catjam) - team 3.  

# What does this project do?
The project is aiming to provide functionality for locating restaurants that are linked to Google Maps by selecting or randomizing food category options via the application named MunchMatch. Users would be able to gain a wonderful experience of choosing preferred restaurants from elegant and user-friendly interfaces.

# Why is this project useful?
The goal of this project is to provide restaurant choices when users are struggling with making decisions. Restaurants generated from different food categories can also be ordered by distance, rate, and other properties. In the meantime, MunchMatch also supports listing the details of each restaurant.

# How to deploy and run this project?
To start the project:
```
cd munch-match
npm start

``` 

To run the tests: 
```
cd munch-match
npm test
```

The ```cd munch-match``` takes you to the directory so it is not needed if you are already in the munch-match folder

# Available versions
A1 provides the basic functions including selecting preferred or random food options, listing restaurant details obtained from Google Maps, and linking to Google Maps. In future versions (A2/A3), some new features such as sharing particular restaurants with friends could be added.
