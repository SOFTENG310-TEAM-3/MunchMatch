# MunchMatch
MutchMatch is a web application that is designed to recommend users on restaurants that they want to eat by enhancing the search process to be in a more efficient and stylish manner. This project is associated with the University of Auckland course SOFTENG310 and was created by KTTJXM (Catjam) - team 3.  

# What does this project do?
The project is aiming to provide functionality for locating restaurants that are linked to Google Maps by selecting or randomizing food category options via the application named MunchMatch. Users would be able to gain a wonderful experience of choosing preferred restaurants from elegant and user-friendly interfaces.

# Why is this project useful?
The goal of this project is to provide restaurant choices when users are struggling with making decisions. Restaurants generated from different food categories can also be ordered by distance, rate, and other properties. In the meantime, MunchMatch also supports listing the details of each restaurant.

# How to deploy and run this project?

To start the project:
```
cd munch-match
npm i 
npm start

``` 

To run the tests: 
```
cd munch-match
npm test
```

The ```cd munch-match``` takes you to the directory so it is not needed if you are already in the munch-match folder.

The ```npm i ``` installs all the dependencies that are needed and only needs to be run once. 

To obtain the Google API Key create an google developer account and enable the Maps Javascript API and Places API for your google API key. You can find more information here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#console

To use the Google API key in the app create an .env file in the munch-match folder and name it ```REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY``` so it would look like ```REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY = API_KEY_HERE```

To obtain the Spoonacular API key, create a free account at https://spoonacular.com/food-api. Once you have created an account, you should be able to find your key in your dashboard.

Once you have the key, copy it into the .env file so it looks like this ```REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY = API_KEY_HERE```

# Available versions
A1 provides the basic functions including selecting preferred or random food options, listing restaurant details obtained from Google Maps, and linking to Google Maps.

A2 provides some added functionality to help the user determine which food they would like, through visualising the randomisation and including a short quiz.

A3 is a more fine tuned version of the app. It provides new features such as a this or that game, filters for the restaurants, and the ability to share restaurants to social medias. Along with these, existing features have been polished and improved.
